# Hemant Verma 🛡️📈  
**Senior Quantitative Researcher | Institutional Risk Architect | Alpha Governance**

I bridge the gap between **Government of India–grade audit discipline** and high‑stakes **quantitative alpha research**. I specialize in “governance‑as‑code”: regime‑aware risk and execution engines that sit *above* strategies to enforce capital protection, behavioral consistency, and audit‑grade transparency.

### 🔬 Featured Quant & Risk Systems

#### 🛡️ ARES‑OS Genesis – Systemic Entropy Engine  
Observability‑first macro and systemic‑risk kernel.  
- Synthesizes a **Systemic Entropy Index** from geopolitics, Web3 capital, energy, health, and metals.  
- Detects non‑linear, cross‑domain stress (Stable → Elevated → Critical) for leverage/hedging overlays.  
- **Stack:** Python, entropy‑based aggregation, OpenTelemetry‑style traces.

#### 📡 Sentinel Prime – Multi‑Asset Governance Shell  
Cloud‑integrated governance layer for XAU, XAG, BTC, and MCX.  
- Enforces governance‑as‑code above execution (regimes, sentiment, kill switches).  
- Real‑time telemetry, FinBERT‑style sentiment‑price divergence, immutable audit logs.  
- **Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Z‑score regime classification.

#### ⚖️ XAU Risk Quant Engine – Regime & Circuit‑Breaker Logic  
Governance‑first risk engine for bullion spot and futures.  
- Replaces discretionary overrides with deterministic risk limits and drawdown‑aware sizing.  
- Produces forensic P&L and regime‑aware circuit‑breaker events for institutional‑style reporting.
