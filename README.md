 > ## Hemant Verma 🛡️📈
> **Quantitative Risk Architect | Market & Model Risk | Governance-First Control Systems**
>
> I bring together **11 years of Government-grade audit and control discipline** with modern **quantitative risk engineering** to design systems that protect capital under stress.
>
> My specialization is **Governance-as-Code** — architecting deterministic, auditable risk frameworks that sit above trading and operational strategies, enforcing regime-aware constraints, control integrity, and forensic transparency.
>
> I do not optimize for short-term alpha.  
> I design systems that remain **stable, reviewable, and enforceable** when markets enter extreme or dislocated states.

> ### 🏛️ Flagship Risk Architecture  
> **ORION-CORE — Institutional Risk Governance & Audit Kernel**
>
> ORION-CORE is an **executable reference architecture** demonstrating how **Model Risk Management (MRM)** and governance can be embedded directly into quantitative systems.
>
> It enforces a strict and intentional separation between **Intelligence (sensing & analytics)** and **Authority (decision control)** — a principle critical in regulated financial environments.
>
> **Key Capabilities**
>
> **• Regime-Aware Risk Surveillance**  
> Integrates volatility, macro stress, and cross-asset signals into structured systemic risk states.
>
> **• Deterministic Governance Controls**  
> Implements non-discretionary exposure limits, escalation thresholds, and protective halt mechanisms aligned with risk regimes.
>
> **• Forensic Audit & Traceability**  
> Every governance decision is cryptographically sealed (**SHA-256**) and logged with telemetry-style traces, enabling post-event audit, lineage analysis, and model review.
>
> **• Institutional Use Case**  
> Designed to mitigate **model drift** and **human-in-the-loop failure** during high-volatility or black-swan conditions.

> ### 🧠 Strategic Control Systems
>
> **Silver Factory Intelligence System (SFIS)**  
> *Operational Risk & Forensic Analytics*
>
> A production-oriented **Enterprise Risk system** focused on capital recovery, inventory reconciliation, and loss attribution in high-notional precious-metals manufacturing.
>
> **• Mass-Balance Enforcement**  
> Tracks 100% of physical metal through multi-stage industrial workflows to eliminate opaque losses.
>
> **• Behavioral & Process Risk Scoring**  
> Applies variance and threshold analytics to identify contractor-level anomalies and operational risk.
>
> **• Audit-Grade Controls**  
> Built-in liability tracking, scrap-vault reconciliation, and ledger integrity designed for forensic review.
>
> *Primary relevance:* **Operational Risk · Controls · Loss Prevention**
>
> ---
>
> **ARES-OS — Systemic Stress & Scenario Research** *(Research Prototype)*
>
> A research kernel exploring **non-linear aggregation of systemic stress** across capital markets, geopolitics, and physical hedges.
>
> **• Cross-Domain Stress Coupling**  
> Synthesizes multi-source stress indicators into structured risk states.
>
> **• Observability-First Design**  
> Applies production-style telemetry to monitor transitions between **Stable → Elevated → Critical** regimes.
>
> *Primary relevance:* **Enterprise Risk · Stress Testing · Scenario Analysis (Research)**
