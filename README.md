## Hi there 👋

Hemant Verma 🛡️📈
Senior Quantitative Researcher · Quantitative Risk Architect · Governance‑First Alpha Design

I design regime‑aware quantitative research and risk engines that sit above trading strategies, enforcing capital protection, behavioral discipline, and audit‑grade transparency.

My background blends institutional audit discipline, bullion & derivatives markets, and cloud‑native quantitative research, with a current focus on systematic XAU / crypto / macro risk systems.

🔬 Research & Engineering Focus
📊 Quantitative Research & Risk
Volatility‑regime detection and drawdown surveillance

Risk‑adjusted signal evaluation (Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown)

Capital‑protection overlays for XAU, XAG, BTC, and MCX contracts

🤖 AI & Statistical Learning
Time‑series feature engineering and regime classification

NLP‑driven narrative & sentiment signals (FinBERT‑style workflows)

Signal validation under non‑stationary market conditions

☁️ Cloud‑Native Research Infrastructure
Python‑based research pipelines and experiment workflows

PostgreSQL / SQLite audit vaults and telemetry logs

Streamlit dashboards for real‑time research observability

🧩 Macro & Systemic Risk
Cross‑domain stress synthesis (metals, crypto liquidity, geopolitics, energy, health)

Regime flags designed for leverage, hedging, and allocation control

🚀 Selected Quant Systems (Code‑First, Research‑Driven)
🛡️ ARES‑OS Genesis — Systemic Entropy Engine
Repo: ARES-OS-GENESIS

Macro‑risk kernel synthesizing multiple domains into a single Systemic Entropy Index

Detects non‑linear stress escalation (Stable → Elevated → Critical)

Designed as a research overlay for portfolio‑level risk modulation

Stack: Python, entropy‑based aggregation, observability‑first design (OpenTelemetry‑style traces)

📡 Sentinel Prime — Multi‑Asset Governance Shell
Live: https://sentinel-prime-governance.streamlit.app
Repo: SENTINEL-PRIME-GOVERNANCE

Strategy‑agnostic governance layer for XAU, XAG, BTC, and MCX instruments

Combines volatility regimes and NLP sentiment into actionable risk states

Outputs position‑scaling factors, regime labels, and kill‑switch triggers

Stack: Python, Streamlit, Supabase (PostgreSQL), FinBERT‑style NLP

⚖️ XAU Risk Quant Engine — Regime & Circuit‑Breaker Logic
Repo: XAU-Risk-Quant-Engine

Deterministic risk engine for bullion spot/futures

Drawdown‑aware position sizing and regime‑conditioned overlays

Forensic‑grade logs for P&L and decision reconstruction

Stack: Python (pandas, NumPy, statsmodels), SQLite/CSV audit vaults

🛠️ Quant Stack
Languages & Data

Python (pandas, NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels, scikit‑learn)

SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)

Quant Methods

Time‑series analysis and feature engineering

Volatility estimation and regime classification

Signal research & backtesting

Risk‑adjusted performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown)

Market Domains

Bullion (XAU/XAG), crypto liquidity, MCX derivatives

Treasury operations and cash‑flow analytics

Macro & systemic risk overlays

🎯 Current Objective (2026)
Contribute as a Senior Quantitative Researcher / Quant Researcher on systematic desks

Focus on alpha research, regime detection, and risk‑governance systems

Open to Singapore‑based and global quant firms that value research rigor, risk discipline, and deployable code
